# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

This repository contains Python code for building and evaluating machine learning models to predict diabetes based on patient attributes. The project aims to develop accurate and reliable models for early detection and risk assessment of diabetes.

## Overview

Diabetes is a widespread health condition affecting millions globally, with early detection playing a crucial role in effective management and treatment. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and other patient attributes. By employing various algorithms and evaluating their performance, the project seeks to provide valuable insights into diabetes prediction and risk assessment.

## Features

- Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes (Gaussian), Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- Evaluation of model performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization of evaluation metrics and model predictions to facilitate interpretation and decision-making.
